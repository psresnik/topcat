abstract: >-
  TOPCAT (Topic-Oriented Protocol for Content Analysis of
  Text) is a software-supported process for
  computer-assisted qualitative content analysis. It can
  dramatically reduce the level of effort needed to do a
  large-scale analysis of text items to develop
  codes/categories, while at the same time maintaining
  human-level quality.  The automated analysis in TOPCAT
  combines state of the art natural language preprocessing
  with MALLET, an approach for discovering topical
  categories in text with a decades-long track record of
  success and,  notably, without notable pitfalls of large
  language models such as privacy risk (if you use a
  commercial API), lack of transparency into what the method
  is actually doing, computational expense, prompt
  sensitivity, model instability, and questionable alignment
  with human categories.

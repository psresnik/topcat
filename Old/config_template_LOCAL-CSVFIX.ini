# Analysis-specific variables
# Edit these for your specific dataset and analysis requirements
# - rootdir will be the top-level output directory for this specific qualitative analysis
# - csv is your input file containing text to be analyzed
# - textcol is the numeric column (numbering from 1) in the csv containing the text items
# - modelname is a readable name for this qualitative analysis
# - granularities are the sizes of the topic models you'll build to decide on granularity
# You shouldn't need to change datadir or outdir
